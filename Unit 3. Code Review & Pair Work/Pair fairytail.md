## Chapter 1. Anna and the Cats
Once there was a lady named Anna. She lived in a small house with two cats â€” Borya and Senya.
Anna was very nice and kind, but also lonley. She had no kids, but her cats were her family.
She made soup for them, talked to them every day, and sometimes even read books aloud to them (they liked detective stories).
